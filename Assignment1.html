			<li>Eggs- 4 nos</li>
			<li>Sugar - 200 gm</li>
			<li>Sugar - 3 tbsp to make caramelized syrup</li>
			<li>Maida - 300 gm</li>
			<li>Vanilla sugar - 1 pack (10 gm)</li>
			<li>Butter - 250 gm</li>
			<li>Baking powder - 1 pack (15 gm)</li>
			<li>Cloves (Grambu) - 5 nos</li>
			<li>Cardamom (Elakka) - 5 pieces</li>
			<li>Cinnamon(Karugapatta) - 5 pieces</li>
			<li>Cashews - 1/2 cup</li>
			<li>Kismis - 1/2 cup</li>
			<li>Candied fruits </li>
			<li>Orange and Lemon peel - 2 cups all mixed together</li>
			
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>First heat a pan with 3 tbsp of sugar in it. Stir it and allow it to melt. </li>
			<li>Take 4 tbsp of water. Wait till the sugar melts and turns to dark brown color. Pour the water into it when it is dark brown in color. Now we have a thick caramel syrup. Keep it aside. </li>
			<li>Melt the butter in a bowl. (Heat it in microwave for some time.) </li>
			<li>Add sugar (200 gm) into it and beat it well.</li>
			<li>Add vanilla sugar into it. </li>
			<li>If it is difficult to get vanilla sugar, add 2 drops of vanilla essence. </li>
			<li>Add 4 eggs into it and beat it well. </li>
			<li>When it is mixed well, mix baking powder and maida thoroughly and add into it. </li>
			<li>Beat it very well. </li>
			<li>Add caramel into it. </li>
			<li>Grind together the masala(cardamom+cinnamon+cloves) into a fine powder and add into it. </li>
			<li>Beat it once again to mix all these ingredients. </li>
			<li>At last we have to add all dried fruits into it. Before that keep aside around 10 - 15 full cashews (we need it to keep on the top of the cake.) and cut the rest of cashews into the small size and mix it with other dried fruits and add it to the cake mix. </li>
			<li>Now don`t beat, but mix it with a tbsp. </li>
			<li>By this time pre heat the oven for 10 minutes 180 degree. </li>
			<li>Pour the mixture to a baking form(I used to make in 26 or 28 cm diameter) and decorate it with cashews on the top. </li>
			<li>Bake it for 1 hour in 180 degree. </li>
			<li>Let it cool for a day before cutting. </li>
		</ol>
